# FreeMazes3D
FreeMazes3D is a free and open source 3D game created using the BabylonJS engine and the Electron framework. The gameplay features retro-themed, labyrinth-style adventure and puzzle solving. Each map is a unique, randomly-generated maze with items to collect and obstacles to overcome. It can be launched and played like a traditional desktop game.

Linux users can download the current release, extract the files, and run the executable. If for some reason you can not double click launch the native Linux FreeMazes3D executable file, you can either launch from a terminal or drag and drop the exectuable into a terminal. Creating a clickable Linux desktop icon is also quite easy in most distros (e.g. just point to a bash script that launches the game from a .desktop file).

Note, Windows/MacOS users will need to clone the project, install the project dependencies, and then build from source.
